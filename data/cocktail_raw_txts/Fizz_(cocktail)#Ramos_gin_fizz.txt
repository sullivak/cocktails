A "'''fizz'''" is a [[mixed drink]] variation on the older [[Sour (cocktail)|sour]]s family of [[cocktail]]. Its defining features are an acidic juice (such as lemon or lime) and [[carbonated water]].

==History==
The first printed reference to "fiz" is in the appendix to the 1876 edition of [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]'s ''Bartender's Guide'', which contains four such recipes.  The fizz became widely popular in America between 1900 and the 1940s.  Known as a hometown specialty of New Orleans, the gin fizz was so popular that bars would employ teams of bartenders that would take turns shaking the drinks. Demand for fizzes went international at least as early as 1950, as evidenced by its inclusion in the French cookbook ''[[L'Art Culinaire Francais]]'' published that year.<ref>How's Your Drink? by Eric Felten published by Surrey Books November 29, 2007</ref>

A gin fizz is the best-known cocktail in the fizz family.  A gin fizz contains gin, lemon juice, and sugar, which are shaken with ice, poured into a tumbler and topped with carbonated water.<ref>[http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=196&tmpl=component&task=preview&Itemid=532 Gin Fizz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The drink is similar to a [[Tom Collins]], with a possible distinction being a Tom Collins historically used "[[Old Tom Gin]]" (a slightly sweeter precursor to [[London Dry Gin]]), whereas the kind of gin historically used in a gin fizz is unknown.<ref name="Great">{{cite news|last=Sinclair|first=George|date=March 26, 2007|work=[[Scribd]]|title=The Great Tom Collins Hoax|accessdate=25 November 2008|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/18790/Tom-Collins-Article}}</ref>

Simple variations on the gin fizz are

A '''Ramos gin fizz''' (also known as a "Ramos fizz" or "New Orleans fizz") contains gin, lemon juice, lime juice, egg white, sugar, cream, [[orange flower water]], and [[soda water]].  It is served in a large non-tapered 12 to 14 ounce Collins glass.<ref>[http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/cuisine/drinks/ramosginfizz.html "Ramos Gin Fizz"], New Orleans Online. Retrieved January 2, 2016.</ref>

The orange flower water and egg significantly affect the flavor and texture of a Ramos, compared to a regular gin fizz.  The key to making this egg cocktail is dissolving the sugar before adding ice; the sugar acts as an emulsifier, and it and the alcohol "cook" the egg white.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/taste/index.ssf/2009/07/creative_cleveland_bartenders.html Creative Cleveland bartenders are the chefs of the cocktail scene]</ref>

Henry C. Ramos invented the Ramos gin fizz in 1888 at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on Gravier Street, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  It was originally called a "New Orleans fizz", and is one of the city's most famous cocktails. Before Prohibition, the drink's popularity and exceptionally long 12-minute mixing time<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj417erX2W8 New Orleans' best cocktails: The Ramos Gin Fizz - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> had over 20 bartenders working at the Imperial at once making nothing but the Ramos gin fizz - and still struggling to keep up with demand. During the carnival of 1915, 32 staff members were on at once, just to shake the drink.

The [[The Roosevelt Hotel New Orleans|Roosevelt Hotel]] in New Orleans also popularized the drink, abetted by Governor [[Huey P. Long|Huey Long's]] fondness for it.  In July 1935, Long brought a bartender named Sam Guarino from the Roosevelt Hotel to the New Yorker Hotel in New York City to teach its staff how to make the drink so he could have it whenever he was there.  The [[Museum of the American Cocktail]] has newsreel footage of this event.  The Roosevelt Hotel group trademarked the drink name in 1935 and still makes it today.

A traditional sloe gin fizz contains [[sloe gin]] (a [[blackthorn|blackthorn plum]] flavored spirit), grapefruit juice, [[Syrup#Simple syrup|simple syrup]], egg white, and carbonated water. 
A popular alternative eliminates the egg white.<ref name="sloeginfizz">[http://www.esquire.com/drinks/sloe-gin-fizz-drink-recipe Sloe Gin Fizz Recipe - Esquire - How to Make the Perfect Sloe Gin Fizz]</ref> 
The original recipe is made with grapefruit juice, because of the mixing of recipes you will find many recipes with lemon juice.
