The '''Between the Sheets''' is a cocktail consisting of [[white rum]] (or other [[light rum]]),<ref>https://www.liquor.com/recipes/between-the-sheets/</ref> [[cognac]], [[triple sec]], and [[lemon juice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Between the Sheets|url=http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=190&Itemid=532|publisher=International Bartenders Association|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
The origin of the cocktail is usually credited to [[Harry MacElhone]] at [[Harry's New York Bar]] in [[Paris]] in the 1930s as a derivative of the [[sidecar (cocktail)|sidecar]].<ref name=ifood>{{cite web|title=Between the Sheets|url=http://ifood.tv/drink/between-the-sheets/about|website=ifood.tv|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Between the Sheets|url=http://www.hennessy.com/us/recipes/between-sheets/|publisher=Hennessy Cognac|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}</ref> However, competing theories exist that claim the cocktail was created at [[The Berkeley]] in approximately 1921, or in French [[brothel]]s as an [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] for consumption by the prostitutes.<ref name=ifood/><ref>{{cite web|title=Between the Sheets|url=https://www.drinkadvisor.com/en/cocktails/547-between-the-sheets.html|publisher=Drink Advisor|accessdate=March 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919003446/https://www.drinkadvisor.com/en/cocktails/547-between-the-sheets.html|archive-date=2015-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>

==Variations==
The drink is similar to the [[sidecar (cocktail)|sidecar]], differing only by using less cognac and adding rum. The Maiden's Prayer is variously known as an alternate name for the Between the Sheets, and as a different drink using [[gin]] instead of rum and cognac, and adding orange juice to the lemon juice.<ref name=ifood /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Paul|title=Time for a Drink: the Maiden's Prayer|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/06/time-for-a-drink-the-maidens-prayer.html|publisher=Serious Eats|accessdate=March 25, 2015|date=June 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=Maiden's Prayer|url=http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3730/maidens-prayer-drink-recipe/|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|accessdate=March 25, 2015|date=November 5, 2007}}</ref>
