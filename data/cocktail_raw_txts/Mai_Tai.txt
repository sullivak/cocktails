The '''Mai Tai''' is a [[cocktail]] based on [[rum]], [[Curaçao liqueur]], [[orgeat syrup]], and [[lime juice]], associated with Polynesian-style settings.

==History==
Victor J. Bergeron claimed to have invented the Mai Tai in 1944 at his restaurant, [[Trader Vic's]], in Oakland, California.<ref>"The Origin of the Mai Tai", [https://web.archive.org/web/20100104142639/http://www.tradervics.com/mai-tai-1.html], tradervics.com via archive.org</ref> Trader Vic's forerunner, [[Don the Beachcomber|Donn Beach]], claimed to have instead first created it in 1933, although a longtime colleague said that Beach was actually just alleging that the Mai Tai was based on his [[Q.B. Cooler]] cocktail.<ref name="add citation">{{cite web |title=Anatomy of a Classic: The Mai Tai Turns 75 |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/anatomy-of-a-classic-the-mai-tai-turns-75 |website=thedailybeast.com |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mai Tai recipe history |url=https://www.eater.com/drinks/2016/11/10/13544698/mai-tai-recipe-history |website=eater.com |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=Jeff |title=Beachbum Berry Remixed |date=2010 |publisher=Slave Labor Graphics |location=San Jose |page=64}}</ref> Don the Beachcomber's recipe is more complex than that of Vic's and some believe tastes quite different.<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles A. |last=Coulombe |title=Rum: The Epic Story of the Drink That Conquered the World |publisher=Citadel Press |year=2005 |page=258}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Ultimate Mai Tai |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/03/16/the-ultimate-mai-tai-in-both-hawaiian-and-trader-vics-styles/ |website=mercurynews.com |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref> Others believe that despite the difference in ingredients that they taste quite similar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=Jeff |title=Beachbum Berry Remixed |date=2010 |publisher=Slave Labor Graphics |location=San Jose |page=69}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Mai Tai History |url=https://caskstrength.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/the-mai-tai-history-a-recipe-a-how-to-an-explanation-and-technique-followed-with-a-shopping-list/ |website=caskstrength.wordpress.com |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref>

The name was allegedly taken from ''maita'i'', the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] word for "good" or "excellence", although the drink is usually spelled as two words, sometimes hyphenated or capitalized.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', third edition, ''s.v.'' [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00299965 mai tai]</ref><ref>[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/maitai "maitai"], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''</ref>

==Recipe==
Most current recipes for Mai Tais based on Trader Vic's 1944 recipe include [[rum]], [[lime juice]], [[orgeat syrup]], and [[orange liqueur]] (typically [[orange curaçao]]). Variants may include the addition of [[falernum]], [[bitters]], [[grenadine]], orange and grapefruit juices, and so on. Various books from Victor Bergeron described using rum from Jamaica as well as from Martinique, which in modern usage is a Rhum Agricole. As noted in ''Smuggler's Cove'' by Martin Cate and Rebecca Cate, the Martinique rums used by Bergeron in the 1950s were most certainly not agricole rums.<ref> {{cite book |last=Cate |first=Martin |date=2016 |title=Smuggler's Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, and the Cult of Tiki |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |page=264 |isbn=978-1-60774-732-1}}</ref> Overproof rums are sometimes added to make stronger versions,<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside LA's Tiki Underground |url=https://punchdrink.com/articles/inside-las-tiki-underground/ |website=punchdrink.com |accessdate=2019-01-30|date=2014-05-21|author=Cacicio, Jennifer}}</ref> but Cate says references to such use as being from "the old way" was only because a 151 proof (75%) [[demerera]] float was the preferred variation of a frequent elderly customer.<ref>{{cite web |title=You deserve a real Mai-Tai |url=https://www.eater.com/drinks/2016/11/10/13544698/mai-tai-recipe-history |website=eater.com |accessdate=2019-01-30|date=2016-11-10|author=Pardilla, Caroline}}</ref>

==Culture==
The Mai Tai became such a popular cocktail in the 1950s–60s that many restaurants, particularly [[Tiki culture|tiki-themed]] restaurants or bars, served them. The Mai Tai was also prominently featured in the [[Elvis Presley]] film ''[[Blue Hawaii]]''.

Today, the Mai Tai is synonymous with [[Tiki culture]] both past and present.

As of 2008, Trader Vic's Restaurant chain began to open small establishments called Mai Tai Bars that primarily serve cocktails and ''[[pupus]]'' (appetizers).
