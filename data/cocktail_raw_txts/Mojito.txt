'''Mojito''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|h|iː|t|oʊ}}; {{IPA-es|moˈxito|lang}}) is a traditional Cuban [[highball]].

Traditionally, a '''mojito''' is a [[cocktail]] that consists of five ingredients: [[Light rum|white rum]], [[sugar]] (traditionally [[sugar cane]] juice), [[lime juice]], [[soda water]], and [[Mentha|mint]].<ref name="ingredients">{{cite web|url=http://www.tasteofcuba.com/mojito.html|title=Traditional Mojito recipe from Cuba|publisher=Tasteofcuba.com|date=|accessdate=2011-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904041701/http://www.tasteofcuba.com/mojito.html|archivedate=2011-09-04|df=}}</ref><ref name="about">{{cite web|author1=Colleen Graham |author2=About.com Guide |url=http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/mjto_cktl.htm |title=About.com Mojito |publisher=Cocktails. about.com |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> Its combination of sweetness, [[citrus]], and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.<ref name="prweb">{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/06/prweb990804.htm |title=Summer Cocktail News: Mojitos Go Fruity |publisher=Prweb.com |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref><ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/12/news/cl-33266 |title=Shake It Up, Baby: Cuban Cocktail Is Making a Splash |last=Fernandez |first=Maria Elena |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>

When preparing a mojito, fresh lime juice is added to sugar (or to simple syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a [[muddler]]. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded.<ref name="wb">{{cite web |author=Fumi |url=http://www.wasabibratwurst.com/mojito-recipe/ |title=How to Muddle a Mojito |publisher=Wasabibratwurst.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811202518/http://www.wasabibratwurst.com/mojito-recipe/ |archive-date=2011-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.

The mojito is one of the most famous rum-based highballs. There are several versions of the mojito.<ref name="havanaclub">{{cite web|url=http://www.havana-club.com/en/cocktails/cuban-classic/mojito.html|title=Cuban Mojito Recipe] or [http://www.bacardimojito.com/features/mojito_recipe_01.htm American Mojito Recipe|publisher=}}</ref>

==History==

Havana, Cuba, is the birthplace of the Mojito,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} although the exact origin of this classic cocktail is the subject of debate. One story traces the Mojito to a similar 16th century drink known as "El Draque", after [[Sir Francis Drake]].<ref name=latimes /> In 1586, after his successful [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|raid at Cartagena de Indias]] Drake's ships sailed towards [[Havana]] but there was an epidemic of [[dysentery]] and [[scurvy]] on board. It was known that the local South American Indians had remedies for various tropical illnesses, so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for an effective medicine. The ingredients were [[aguardiente]] de caña (translated as ''burning water'', a crude form of [[rum]] made from sugar cane) mixed with local tropical ingredients: lime, sugarcane juice, and mint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burkhart |first=Jeff |year=2012 |title=Twenty Years Behind Bars: the spirited adventures of a real bartender |edition=1st |publisher=PhotoCine Media |isbn=9780985500115}}</ref> Lime juice on its own would have significantly prevented scurvy and dysentery,<ref>{{cite web|last=Maratos|first=David|title=How The El Draque Cocktail May Have Helped Britannia Rule The Waves|date=7 July 2010|url=http://goarticles.com/article/How-The-El-Draque-Cocktail-May-Have-Helped-Britannia-Rule-The-Waves/3077001/|work=GoArticles|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050107/http://goarticles.com/article/How-The-El-Draque-Cocktail-May-Have-Helped-Britannia-Rule-The-Waves/3077001/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Maratos|first=David||url=http://articleworld.drupalgardens.com/content/1st-cocktail-invented-1586-was-medicinal-crude-rum-mix-article-34 |title=The 1st Cocktail, Invented 1586 Was A Medicinal Crude Rum Mix (Article 34)|date=16 June 2012|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928055922/http://articleworld.drupalgardens.com/content/1st-cocktail-invented-1586-was-medicinal-crude-rum-mix-article-34|archivedate=28 September 2012}}</ref> and [[tafia]]/rum was soon added as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh taste of this spirit. While this drink was not called a Mojito at this time, it was the original combination of these ingredients.<ref name=latimes />

Some historians contend that African slaves who worked in the Cuban sugar cane fields during the 19th century were instrumental in the cocktail's origin.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.mojitocompany.com/pages.php?pageid=4 |title=Mojito History |publisher=Mojitocompany.com |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412010312/http://www.mojitocompany.com/pages.php?pageid=4 |archive-date=12 April 2009}}</ref> [[Sugar cane juice|Guarapo]], the sugar cane juice often used in Mojitos,<ref name=latimes /> was a popular drink among the slaves who named it.<ref name=history />  It never originally contained lime juice.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lands of the inner sea, the West Indies and Bermuda |first=Walter Adolphe |last=Roberts |year=1948 |page=21 |publisher=Coward-McCann |location=New York |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3296573;view=1up;seq=41}}</ref><ref>Sky juice and flying fish: traditional Caribbean cooking by Jessica B.

There are several theories behind the origin of the name Mojito: one such theory holds that name relates to [[mojo (sauce)|mojo]], a Cuban seasoning made from lime and used to flavour dishes.<ref name=latimes /><ref>''Mojito'' is derived from the Spanish ''mojo sauce'', which often contains lime juice (see [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mojito "mojito" at Dictionary.com], citing the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2006, Houghton Mifflin), while ''mojo'' is derived from the Spanish verb ''mojar'', meaning "to make wet" (see [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mojo definition 3 of "mojo" at Dictionary.com], citing Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.7), 2003–2007, Lexico Publishing Group, LLC)</ref> Another theory is that the name Mojito is simply a derivative of ''mojadito'' (Spanish for "a little wet"), the diminutive of ''mojado'' ("wet").<ref name="bevvy">{{cite web|last=Shenton |first=Will |url=https://bevvy.co/articles/the-history-of-the-mojito/938 |title=The History of the Mojito |publisher=Bevvy.co |date=2016-07-11 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>

The Mojito has routinely been presented as a favorite drink of [[author]] [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6624971|title=Great American Writers and Their Cocktails|date=2006-12-15|work=NPR.org|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref> It has also often been said that Ernest Hemingway made the bar called [[Bodeguita del Medio|La Bodeguita del Medio]] famous when he became one of its regulars and wrote "My mojito in La Bodeguita, My [[daiquiri]] in [[El Floridita]]" on a wall of the bar.

A survey by an international market research company found that in 2016 the Mojito was the most popular cocktail in Britain and France.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global cocktail consumption highlights opportunity for British bars and suppliers|url=http://www.cgapeach.co.uk/peach-report/2016/7/13/global-cocktail-consumption-highlights-opportunity-for-british-bars-and-suppliers|work=International Cocktail Report|publisher=CGA Strategy|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629000315/http://www.cgapeach.co.uk/peach-report/2016/7/13/global-cocktail-consumption-highlights-opportunity-for-british-bars-and-suppliers|archive-date=29 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Variations==
<!-- Please do not add a variation without also including a reliable source. Wikipedia is not for sharing personal inventions. -->

Many hotels in [[Havana]] also add [[Angostura bitters]] to cut the sweetness of the Mojito; while [[icing sugar]] is often muddled with the mint leaves rather than cane sugar, and many establishments simply use [[syrup|sugar syrup]] to control sweetness.<ref name="AUSTIN">{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A395771 |title=Food: Mojito |newspaper=The Austin Chronicle |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> Many bars today in Havana use lemon juice rather than fresh lime.

A dirty mojito calls for gold rum instead of white rum and to use raw sugar or demerara sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumtherapy.com/2013/04/10-mojito-variations/|title=10 Mojito Variations – Rum Therapy|publisher=}}</ref> Demerara is a light brown, partially refined, sugar produced from the first crystallization during processing cane juice into sugar crystals.
