The '''Americano''' is an [[List of IBA official cocktails|IBA official cocktail]]<ref name="IBA-wcc">{{cite web|url=http://iba-world.com/iba-cocktails/|title=The Unforgettables|work=[[International Bartenders Association]]|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref> composed of [[Campari]], [[sweet vermouth]], and for the sparkling version, [[club soda]].<ref>https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/2-ingredient-cocktails/</ref> The cocktail was first served in creator [[Gaspare Campari]]'s bar, Caffè Campari, in the 1860s. It was originally known as the "Milano-Torino" because of its ingredients: [[Campari]], the bitter liqueur, is from [[Milan]] (Milano) and [[Punt e Mes]], the vermouth, is from [[Turin]] (Torino).

==In popular culture==
It is the first drink ordered by [[James Bond]] in the [[debut novel|first novel]] in [[Ian Fleming]]'s series, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. In the short story "[[From a View to a Kill]]", Bond chooses an Americano as an appropriate drink for a mere café; suggesting that "in cafés you have to drink the least offensive of the musical comedy drinks that go with them."<ref>Fleming, Ian. "From a View to a Kill" in ''The Complete James Bond Short Stories''. New York, 2004.'''</ref> Bond always stipulates [[Perrier]], for, in his opinion, expensive soda water was the cheapest way to improve a poor drink.

It is the preferred drink of Kriminalkomissar Gereon Rath in ''Der Nasse Fisch'', the first book of the eponymous criminal novel series set in Berlin in the late 1920s.
