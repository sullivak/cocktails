The '''Bramble''' is a cocktail created by [[Dick Bradsell]] in 1980s London, England. Best described as a spring cocktail, the Bramble brings together dry [[gin]], [[lemon]] juice, sugar syrup, [[Crème liqueur|crème de mûre]], and crushed ice. Bradsell also suggests finishing off the cocktail with some fresh red fruits (such as blackberries, cranberries) and a slice of lemon. It closely resembles the popular [[Gin Fix]].

If crème de mûre is unavailable, many bartenders will substitute creme de cassis for it.

The name of the drink comes from the fact that blackberry bushes are called [[bramble]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/305/bramble|quote=A bramble, by the way, is the bush that blackberries grow on.|title=Bramble|work=Difford's Guide|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref>
