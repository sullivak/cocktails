'''Daiquiri'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|ər|i|,_|ˈ|d|æ|k|-}}; {{lang-es|daiquirí}} {{IPA-es|daikiˈɾi|}}) is a family of [[cocktails]] whose main ingredients are [[rum]], citrus juice (typically [[lime juice]]), and [[sugar]] or other sweetener.

The daiquiri is one of the [[The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks#Six basic drinks|six basic drinks]] listed in [[David A. Embury]]'s classic ''[[The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks]]'', which also lists some variations.

== Origins ==
''[[Daiquirí, Cuba|Daiquirí]]'' is also the name of a beach and an [[mining|iron mine]] near [[Santiago de Cuba]], and is a word of [[Taíno people|Taíno]] origin.<ref name=taino>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html |title= Taíno Dictionary |author=The United Confederation of Taíno People |accessdate=2007-10-18|language=Spanish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055722/http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-16}}</ref>  The drink was supposedly invented by an American mining engineer, named [[Jennings Cox]], who was in Cuba at the time of the [[Spanish–American War]]. It is also possible that [[William A. Chanler]], a [[United States House of Representatives|US congressman]] who purchased the Santiago iron mines in 1902, introduced the daiquiri to clubs in [[New York City|New York]] in that year.<ref>Thomas, Lately. ''A pride of lions: the Astor orphans; the Chanler chronicle'', W. Morrow, 1971; p. 168.</ref>

Originally the drink was served in a [[tall glass]] packed with cracked ice. A teaspoon of sugar was poured over the ice and the juice of one or two limes was squeezed over the sugar. Two or three ounces of white [[rum]] completed the mixture. The glass was then frosted by stirring with a long-handled [[spoon]]. Later the daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a [[cocktail shaker|shaker]] with the same ingredients but with shaved ice. After a thorough shaking, it was poured into a chilled [[coupe glass]].

Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when [[Rear Admiral]] Lucius W. Johnson, a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] medical officer, tried Cox's drink. Johnson subsequently introduced it to the [[Army and Navy Club (Washington, D.C.)|Army and Navy Club]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and drinkers of the daiquiri increased over the space of a few decades. It was one of the favorite drinks of writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] and President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite book

The drink became popular in the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[World War II]] rationing made [[whiskey]] and [[vodka]] hard to come by, yet because of U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Good Neighbor policy]] rum was easily obtainable because the policy opened up trade and travel relations with Latin America, Cuba and the Caribbean. The Good Neighbor policy, also known as the Pan-American program, helped make Latin America fashionable. Consequently, rum-based drinks (once frowned upon as being the choice of sailors and down-and-outs), also became fashionable, and the daiquiri saw a tremendous rise in popularity in the US.

The basic recipe for a daiquiri is also similar to the [[grog]] British sailors drank aboard ship from the 1780s as a means of preventing scurvy. By 1795 the [[Royal Navy]] daily grog ration contained rum, water, ¾ ounce of lemon or lime juice, and 2 ounces of sugar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scurvy|author=Stephen R. Bown|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|year=2003|page=181|isbn=0-312-31391-8}}</ref> This was a common drink across the Caribbean, and as soon as ice became available this was included instead of the water.

== Frozen daiquiri ==
A wide variety of alcoholic mixed drinks made with finely pulverized ice are often called '''frozen daiquirí'''. These drinks can also be combined and poured from a [[blender]], eliminating the need for manual [[pulverisation]] and producing a texture similar to a [[smoothie]]. On larger scales, such drinks are often commercially made in larger machines, and come in a wide variety of flavors made with various alcohol or liquors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Another way to create a frozen daiquiri (mostly fruit-flavored variants) is by using frozen [[limeade]], providing the required texture, sweetness and sourness all at once.<ref name="strawberry_recipe">{{cite web|url=http://mybestcocktails.com/recipe-80-Strawberry-Daiquiri.html|title=Strawberry Daiquiri|website=MyBestCocktails}}</ref>
