A '''Grasshopper''' is a sweet, mint-flavored, after-dinner drink. The name of the drink derives from its green color, which comes from [[crème de menthe]]. A bar in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], Tujague's, claims the drink was invented in 1918<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebollard.com/bollard/?p=2119 |title= The Land of Forgotten Cocktails |date= August 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207002514/http://www.thebollard.com/bollard/?p=2119 |archivedate=2009-12-07 }}</ref> by its owner, Philip Guichet. The drink gained popularity during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the [[American South]].

==Composition==
A typical Grasshopper cocktail consists of equal parts green [[crème de menthe]], white [[crème de cacao]], and cream shaken with ice and strained into a chilled cocktail glass.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.alcomixer.com/recipe/grasshopper |title= Flying Grasshopper recipe }}</ref>

An "After Eight" adds a layer of dark chocolate liqueur to the crème de menthe, crème de cacao and cream.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.passionforcocktails.com/en/vodka/after-eight |title= After Eight |accessdate= 2017-11-08 }}</ref>

In the North Central United States, especially Wisconsin, Grasshoppers are blended drinks, with ice cream substituted for cream.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Punch |url=https://punchdrink.com/recipes/blended-grasshopper/ |title=PUNCH &#124; Blended Grasshopper |accessdate=2018-01-12}}</ref>  A related variation is the "Grasshopper milkshake", it contains [[mint chocolate chip]] [[ice cream]], [[milk]], and crème de menthe. This is blended and served in a tall glass decorated with a miniature or broken cream-filled chocolate [[sandwich cookie]].<ref name="Sunset">{{cite web |url= http://food.sunset.com/sunset/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&recipe_id=659259 |title= Grasshopper Milkshake |accessdate= 2017-11-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100519001941/http://find.myrecipes.com:80/recipes/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&recipe_id=659259 |archivedate= 2010-05-19 }}</ref>
