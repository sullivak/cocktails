==History==

The Harvey Wallbanger appears in literature as early as 1971.<ref>Commercial prints and labels: Volumes 21–26 by Library of Congress. Copyright Office in 1971</ref><ref>"Harvey Wallbanger is taking Bloody Mary's place at brunch; try a drink with Galliano."  ''Sports illustrated'', p. 9 (May 31, 1971).</ref>  The cocktail is reputed to have been invented in 1952 by three-time world champion [[mixologist]] Donato "Duke" Antone, and named by Antone after a surfer frequenting Antone's Blackwatch Bar in Los Angeles.  However, recent research by culinary historians casts doubt on this theory.  [[Robert Simonson]] goes so far as to say that "no sane person ever believed that story."<ref>{{cite news |title=How Classic Cocktails got their name |url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/news/a3439/harvey-wallbanger-last-word-and-sazerac-cocktails/ |work=Town & Country Magazine |first=Sam |last=Dangremond |date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>  Simonson emphasizes the lack of a historical record for any Blackwatch Bar, and indicates that, in fact, Antone lived in Hartford, Connecticut, rather than Los Angeles during the relevant period.<ref name="Simonson">{{cite news |title=Searching for Harvey Wallbanger |first=Robert |last=Simonson |date=December 14, 2012 |work=Saveur Magazine |url=http://www.saveur.com/article/wine-and-drink/Harvey-Wallbanger}}</ref> 

Other historians such as David Wondrich emphasize the role of McKesson Imports Company and its marketing team for developing the drink, confirming among other things that the company commissioned a graphic artist to develop a "Harvey Wallbanger" sandal-clad surfer mascot in the late 1960s.<ref name=Simonson/>  It is known that McKesson executive [[George Bednar]] was instrumental in promoting the drink as a means of selling its component [[Galliano (liqueur)|Galliano]] liqueur, and Bednar claimed to have penned a popular tagline for the drink: "Harvey Wallbanger is the name.  And I can be made!".<ref>{{cite news | title = Obituary: George Bednar, 65, Was Successful Entrepreneur| work = News-Times (Danbury, CT) | publisher = | date = December 12, 2007 |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/George-Bednar-65-was-successful-entrepreneur-100037.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Long| first = Sherry | title = Area Cocktail King, Football Star Bednar Dies| work = Wilkes-Barre (PA) Times-Leader | publisher = | date = December 11, 2007 }}</ref>
