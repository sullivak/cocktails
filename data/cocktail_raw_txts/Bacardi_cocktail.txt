The '''Bacardi cocktail''' is an [[IBA Official Cocktail]] made primarily with [[Bacardi Superior]].  It is served as a "pre-dinner" cocktail.

==History==

The Bacardi Cocktail was originally the same as the [[Daiquiri]], containing rum, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, and sugar<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woon|first1=Basil|title=When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba|date=1928|publisher=Horace Liveright}}</ref>; The [[Grenadine]] version of the Bacardi Cocktail originated in the US, while the original non-red Bacardi company recipe originated from Cuba.

On April 28, 1936 the [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled that the drink must contain Bacardi rum in order to be called a Bacardi cocktail.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeGroff|first1=Dale|title=The Essential Cocktail: The Art of Mixing Perfect Drinks|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=0307762459}}</ref>
