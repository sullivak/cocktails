The '''Aviation''' is a classic [[cocktail]] made with [[gin]], [[maraschino]] [[liqueur]], [[crème de violette]], and [[lemon juice]]. Some recipes omit the crème de violette. It is served [[Straight up (bartending)|straight up]], in a cocktail glass.

==History==
The Aviation was created by Hugo Ensslin, head [[bartender]] at the Hotel Wallick in New York, in the early twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aviation | url=http://www.drinkboy.com/Cocktails/Recipe.aspx?itemid=10 | last=Hess | first= Robert | publisher=Drinkboy.com | accessdate=5 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110121120104/http://drinkboy.com/Cocktails/Recipe.aspx?itemid=10| archivedate= 21 January 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The first published recipe for the drink appeared in Ensslin's 1916 ''Recipes for Mixed Drinks''. Ensslin's recipe called for 1½ oz. El Bart gin, ¾ oz. lemon juice, 2 dashes maraschino liqueur, and 2 dashes crème de violette, a violet [[liqueur]] which gives the cocktail a pale purple color.<ref>{{cite book | title=Recipes for Mixed Drinks | last=Ensslin | first=Hugo | publisher=Mud Puddle Books Inc | year=2009 | origyear=1917 | isbn=978-1-60311-190-4}}</ref> 

[[Harry Craddock]]'s influential ''[[Savoy Cocktail Book]]'' (1930) omitted the crème de violette, calling for a mixture of two-thirds dry gin, one-third lemon juice, and two dashes of maraschino.<ref name="Craddock25">{{cite book|first=Harry|last=Craddock|title=The Savoy Cocktail Book|publisher=Constable & Co.|location=London|year=1930|isbn=978-1-62654-0644|p=25}}</ref>  Many later bartenders have followed Craddock's lead, leaving out the difficult-to-find violet liqueur.<ref name="Regan209">{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Regan |title=The Joy of Mixology |publisher=Clarkson Potter/Publishers |location=New York |year=2003 |p=209 |isbn=0-609-60884-3}}</ref>

[[Creme Yvette]], a violet liqueur made with additional spices, is sometimes substituted for crème de violette.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/all-we-can-eat/spirits/spirits-we-want-creme-yvette.html | title= Spirits: We Want Creme Yvette! |work=The Washington Post | date=7 October 2009 | accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>
