'''French 75''' is a [[cocktail]] made from [[gin]], [[Champagne]], lemon juice, and sugar. It is also called a '''75 Cocktail''', or in French simply a ''Soixante Quinze'' (Seventy Five).

The drink dates to [[World War I]], and an early form was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris—later [[Harry's New York Bar]]—by barman [[Harry MacElhone]]. The combination was said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75mm field gun]].

==History==
[[File:Batterie d'honneur de l'artillerie française - Investiture présidentielle du 15 mai 2012 - 031.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897]] is the source of the name of the cocktail]]
The drink with its current name and recipe developed over the 1920s, though similar drinks date to the 19th century. In the 19th century, the ''Champagne cup'' was a popular cocktail, consisting of champagne, lemon juice, sugar, and ice. Gin was sometimes added, yielding a drink much like the French 75.<ref>"[http://liquor.com/articles/behind-the-drink-the-french-75/ Behind the Drink: The French 75]", David Wondrich, July 09, 2012</ref>

The drink was first recorded as the '''75''' in ''Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails'', 1922 edition, by Harry MacElhone, and in the same year in Robert Vermeire's ''Cocktails: How to Mix Them,'' which credits the drink to MacElhone.<ref name="ford">"[http://cold-glass.com/2012/10/28/the-french-75-cocktail/ The French 75 Cocktail — Tom Collins in a Tuxedo]", by Doug Ford, October 28, 2012</ref> However, the recipes differed from the current form – MacElhone's version consisted of Calvados, gin, grenadine, and absinthe, while Vermeire added lemon juice.<ref name="ford"/>

The recipe took its now-classic form and "French 75" name in ''Here’s How'', by Judge Jr. (1927), consisting of gin, sugar, lemon juice, and champagne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1927-Here-s-How-2nd-impression/28|title=1927 Here's How by Judge Jr ( 2nd impression)|website=euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz}}</ref> This recipe was republished with the name '''French 75''' in ''[[The Savoy Cocktail Book]]'' (1930), which helped popularize the drink. Some later cocktail books use [[Cognac]] instead of gin, such as ''[[The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks]]'' by [[David A. Embury]].

The French 75 was popularized in America at the [[Stork Club]] in New York. It appears in the movie ''[[Casablanca (movie)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) and is referenced twice in the [[John Wayne]] films ''[[A Man Betrayed (1941 film)|A Man Betrayed]]'' (1941) and ''[[Jet Pilot (film)|Jet Pilot]]'' (1957).  In 2016, it appears in the ITV series, ''[[Mr. Selfridge]]'', which is set in London in the 1910s and 1920s.

A fanciful alternative story of the invention of the French 75 was related by [[Jean Shepherd]] on November 17, 1969, wherein he credits [[Gervais Raoul Lufbery]] as the inventor. The mixture, as related by Shepherd, is Champagne and Cognac on ice with perhaps a twist of [[lemon]].<ref>[http://podbay.fm/show/129951381/e/1185336300 Podcast] 27:00</ref> This version is not credible, given the documented earlier version.

==Similar drinks==
The recipe of the French 75 is very similar to one of the most popular cocktails, the [[Tom Collins]], with Champagne replacing [[carbonated water]]. According to the recipe in Harry MacElhone's book ''Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails,'' a French 75 is supposed to be served in a [[highball glass]]. The Highball glass, which the Tom Collins Cocktail is also served in, would support the theory of French 75 being a variation of the Tom Collins.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
