==History==
The origins of the ''yellow bird'' name is unclear.<ref name="Charming">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJKr67ceXpMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Knack Bartending Basics: More than 400 Classic and Contemporary Cocktails for Any Occasion |author=Charming, Cheryl |page=101 |year=2009 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781599217727 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> Some sources mention that the cocktail was named after the [[Haiti]]an tune "[[Choucoune (song)#Versions|Yellow Bird]],"<ref name="Charming"/><ref name="Harris">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SgRAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&dq=Yellow+Bird+cocktail&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzgKahUKEwiP4vzj8JbGAhXIKKwKHRM3ADg#v=onepage&q=Yellow%20Bird%20cocktail&f=false |title=Rum Drinks: 50 Caribbean Cocktails, From Cuba Libre to Rum Daisy |author=Harris, Jessica B. |page=110 |year=2009 |isbn=9780811866996 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> that was first rewritten in English in 1957<ref name="Charming"/> that became a sort of national anthem of the Caribbean due to the popularity of [[Harry Belafonte]]'s recording.<ref name="Harris"/> [[Hawaii]]an singer [[Arthur Lyman]], one of the influencers of the [[tiki culture#music|tiki culture]]'s [[exotica]] music, released a version of the song which rose to #4 in July 1961 on the Billboard charts and was played weekly at Shell Bar in ''[[Hilton Hawaiian Village|The Hawaii Village]]'', a possible birthplace of the cocktail.<ref name="Charming"/>

Others argue that it was ''not'' named after the song and obtains the name from its sunny color resulting from [[Galliano (liqueur)|Galliano]], a golden, sweet vanilla-anise Italian liqueur<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-z1jAAAAMAAJ&q |title=A Taste of Cuba: Recipes from the Cuban-American Community |author=Creen, Linette |page=292 |year=1991 |publisher=Dutton |isbn=9780525249702 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> or from its color combination of yellow and orange fruits that are accompanied by a ''golden rum''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjxjAAAAMAAJ&q |title=Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking |author=Dedeaux, Devra |page=203 |year=1989 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780070624573 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> It is worth mentioning that this IBA does not include this latter ingredient.<ref>[http://iba-world.com/new-era-drinks/yellow-bird/ International Bar Association (IBA)]</ref>
