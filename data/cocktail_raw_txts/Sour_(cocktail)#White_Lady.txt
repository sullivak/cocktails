A '''sour''' is a traditional family of [[mixed drink]]s. Common examples of sours are the [[margarita]] and the [[Sidecar (cocktail)|sidecar]]. ''Sours'' belong to one of the old families of original cocktails and are described by [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]] in his 1862 book ''How to Mix Drinks''.<ref name="Cocktail Chronicles">Paul Clarke.

===Gin sour===
The '''gin sour''' is a traditional [[mixed cocktail]] that predates [[prohibition in the United States]]. It is a simple combination of gin, lemon juice, and sugar. Adding carbonated water to this turns it into a [[gin fizz]].

It was popular during the 1940s, and [[Kevin Starr]] includes it in "an array of drinks (the gin sour, the whiskey sour, the [[Lime Rickey|Gin Rickey]], the [[Tom Collins]], the [[Pink Lady (cocktail)|Pink Lady]], the [[Old Fashioned]]) that now seem period pieces, evocative of another era."{{ref|starr}}

'''White Lady''' (also known as a '''Delilah''',<ref name=spruce>{{cite web |url=https://www.thespruce.com/delilah-cocktail-recipe-759293 |title=Delilah Cocktail or White Lady Cocktail Gin Recipe |website=the spruce |date=15 November 2016  |author=Colleen Graham |accessdate= 3 March 2017}}</ref> or '''Chelsea Side-car'''<ref name=spruce/><!--These names deleted from the article; need a reliable source that isn't a likely copy from Wikipedia: '''Kiernander''', '''Janikedvence''' and '''Lillian Forever'''-->) is essentially a [[Sidecar (cocktail)|sidecar]] made with [[gin]] in place of [[brandy]].  What makes it different from the simple gin sour is the switching of sugar for triple sec. The cocktail sometimes also includes additional ingredients, for example [[egg white]], [[sugar]], or [[cream]].

The classic concoction is most commonly served in a Martini [[cocktail glass]]. When an egg white is added a [[Champagne stemware|champagne coupe]] is preferable; the silky foam clings more pleasingly to the curved glass.

It is disputed who originally invented the drink. There are at least two different opinions: first that it was devised by Harry MacElhone in 1919 at Ciro's Club in London. He originally used [[crème de menthe]], but replaced it with gin at [[Harry's New York Bar]] in Paris in 1929.<ref name="firstref">{{Cite web|url=http://www.drinkoftheweek.com/archive/w/white_lady.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208074230/http://www.drinkoftheweek.com/archive/w/white_lady.htm|deadurl=y|title=Drink Recipe - White Lady<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=February 8, 2007}}</ref>

But [[American Bar|The Savoy's]] [[Harry Craddock]] also claims the White Lady (gin, Cointreau, fresh lemon juice). The recipe appears in his ''Savoy Cocktail Book'', published in 1930.<ref name="secondref">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050219/ai_n9769314 101 cocktails that shook the world: #5: The White Lady | Independent, The (London) | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Joe Gilmore]], former Head Barman at The Savoy, says this was one of [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s favorite drinks.<ref>The Savoy: Checking into History" [[Channel 4]] TV UK</ref>

In [[John le Carré]]'s 1965 novel ''[[The Looking Glass War]]'', British spy and main protagonist Fred Leiser's favorite drink is a White Lady, and he makes several attempts to get other agents to try the cocktail.

In [[Dorothy Sayers]]' mystery novel ''[[Have His Carcase]]'' Lord Peter has a White Lady when he hears about his "Lady" Miss Harriet Vane being in trouble again.

===Pisco sour===
{{main|Pisco Sour}}
The classic '''Pisco Sour''' recipe contains [pisco] brandy (usually an un-aged grape brandy from Perú), fresh lime juice, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and [[bitters]].<ref name="LA Speakeasy">Navarro, V. [https://www.laspeakeasy.com/pisco-sour/ Classic Pisco Sour] ''LA Speakeasy''</ref> It is [[Cocktail shaker|shaken]], [[Cocktail strainer|strained]], and served [[Straight up (bartending)|straight]] in a cocktail glass then garnished with the bitters (cinnamon can be used).

===Whiskey sour===

{{main|Whiskey sour}}

The '''whiskey sour''' is a [[mixed drink]] containing [[bourbon whiskey]], lemon juice, sugar, and optionally a dash of egg white to make it a Boston Sour. It is shaken and served either straight or over ice. The traditional garnish is half an orange slice and a [[maraschino cherry]].

A notable variant of the whiskey sour is the [[Ward 8 (cocktail)|Ward 8]], which often is based with either bourbon or rye whiskey, both lemon and orange juices, and grenadine syrup as the sweetener. The egg white sometimes employed in other whiskey sours is generally not included in this variation.

===Other sours===
* '''Amaretto Sour''': [[Amaretto]] liqueur, lemon juice and sometimes egg white, bitters or sugar syrup.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amaretto Sour|url=https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/53/amaretto-sour|website=Difford's Guide|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>
* '''Brandy Sour''' or [[Brandy Daisy]] (Jerry Thomas, 1887): brandy, clear or orange [[curaçao liqueur|curaçao]], sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass.
* '''[[Caipirinha]]''': [[Cachaça]], sugar, lime, ice in an [[Old Fashioned glass]].

* '''Midori Sour''': Honeydew melon liquor, grenadine, lemon juice. Poured properly, it resembles a green Tequila Sunrise with visible layers.
* '''Santa Cruz Sour''' (Jerry Thomas, 1887): Santa Cruz rum, sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass.
* '''Tequila Sour''': Tequila, lemon juice, lime juice, agave nectar, bittercube corazon bitters, egg white.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tequila Sour|url=http://recipe.awesomedrinks.com/recipe/tequila-sour/|website=Awesome Drinks|accessdate=}}</ref>
