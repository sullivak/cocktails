The '''Black Russian''' is a [[cocktail]] of [[vodka]] and [[coffee liqueur]]. It contains five parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per [[IBA Official Cocktail|IBA]] specified ingredients. Traditionally, the drink is made by pouring the vodka over [[ice cube]]s or cracked ice in an [[old-fashioned glass]], followed by the coffee liqueur.<ref>{{Cite web | title = SpiritDrinks.com - Black Russian | publisher = SpiritDrinks | url = http://www.spiritdrinks.com/cocktails/Black_Russian.asp | accessdate = July 12, 2010}}</ref>
