A '''pisco sour''' is an alcoholic [[cocktail]] of [[Peru|Peruvian]] origin that is typical of the cuisines from [[Peruvian cuisine|Peru]]. The drink's name comes from ''[[pisco]]'', which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term ''[[Sour (cocktail)|sour]]'', in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The [[Peru]]vian pisco sour uses Peruvian ''pisco'' as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple [[syrup]], ice, [[egg white]], and [[Angostura bitters]]. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean ''pisco'' and [[Pica, Chile|pica]] lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like [[pineapple]] or plants such as [[coca]] leaves.

Although the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in [[Lima]], the capital of Peru, by the American [[bartender]] [[Victor Vaughen Morris]].<ref name="Origin"/> Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in [[Cerro de Pasco]], a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.

In [[Chile]], folklorist [[Oreste Plath]] attributed the invention of the drink to [[Elliot Stubb]], an English [[Steward's assistant|steward]] of a ship named ''Sunshine'', who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of [[Iquique]], which at that time was part of [[Peru]]. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of the [[whiskey sour]]—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of [[Valparaíso]], Chile.

Cocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a [[South American cuisine|South American]] classic.{{efn-ua|Despite the pisco sour being predominantly emblematic along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]] of Peru and Chile, Casey calls it a "classic South American drink" and Bovis says it is "a hallmark South American cocktail."{{sfn|Casey|2009|p=89}}{{sfn|Bovis|2012|loc=Pisco Sour}}}} Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their [[List of national liquors|national drink]], and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor—pisco;{{efn-ua|Peru considers that the name "pisco" should be of exclusive [[geographical indication]] to the aguardiente produced in designated regions within its territory.<ref name="Acosta Gonzalez">{{cite web|author=Acosta González, Martín |url=http://elcomercio.pe/gastronomia/peruana/que-paises-reconocen-pisco-como-peruano-cuales-como-chileno-noticia-1418070| title=Qué países reconocen el pisco como peruano y cuáles como chileno|work=El Comercio|publisher=Empresa Editora El Comercio|date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref> Chile also has designated regions of pisco production within its territory, but claims exclusivity of the liquor under the name "Pisco Chile".<ref name="Acosta Gonzalez"/>}} consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of [[Latin America]]n popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly [[public holiday]] in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.

== Name ==
The term ''sour'' refers to mixed drinks containing a base [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] (bourbon or some other whiskey), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener.{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=159}} ''Pisco'' refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. In the book ''Latin America and the Caribbean'', historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Colonial Peru]] and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the [[Andes]]. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] to establish distilleries "to make wine into brandy",{{sfn|Blouet|Blouet|2009|p=318}} and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.<ref>{{cite web|author=Real Academia Española|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=pisco|title=Pisco|work=Diccionario de la Lengua Española|edition=Vigésima Segunda Edición|accessdate=3 July 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Concise Oxford Dictionary|url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/pisco|title=Pisco|publisher=WordReference.com|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>

The first [[Vitis|grapevines]] were brought to Peru shortly after its [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest by Spain]] in the 16th century.

According to historian [[Luciano Revoredo]], the preparation of pisco with lemon dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the ''[[Mercurio Peruano]]'' which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's ''[[Plaza de toros de Acho]]'', the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named ''Punche'' ([[Punch (drink)|Punch]]), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian [[Pisco punch]], invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of [[San Francisco]], California.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pilar Lazo Rivera, Carmen del|url=http://www.pediatriaperu.org/images/stories/PDF/62N1/revista%20pediatria%20interior.pdf#page=59|title=Pisco Sour del Perú|publisher=Pediatraperu.org|year=2009|accessdate=3 July 2015|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221227/http://www.pediatriaperu.org/images/stories/PDF/62N1/revista%20pediatria%20interior.pdf#page=59|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}</ref> A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook ''Manual de Cocina a la Criolla''; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that "[i]t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook."{{sfn|McDonnell|2015|p=172}}

The pisco sour's initial recipe was that of a simple cocktail.{{sfn|Duecy|2013|loc=Pisco Sour}} According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, "it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days."<ref name=Toro>{{cite web|author=Guillermo L.

Morris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention.

Over time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the [[Hotel Bolívar]] and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments.<ref name=Toro/> In 1929, Morris declared voluntary [[bankruptcy]] and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=Tatiana/><ref name=Toro/>

=== Nationality dispute ===

Victor Vaughen Morris is considered by most historians to be the inventor of the cocktail.{{sfn|Duecy|2013|loc=Pisco Sour}} Despite this, there exists an ongoing dispute between Chile and Peru over the origin of the pisco sour.{{sfn|Sandham|2012|p=251}} In Chile, a local [[Urban legend|story]] developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the pisco sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a [[sailing ship]] named ''Sunshine''. Chilean folklorist and historian [[Oreste Plath]] contributed to the legend's propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper ''El Comercio de Iquique'', in 1872, after obtaining leave to disembark, Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of [[Iquique]] and invented the pisco sour while experimenting with drinks.<ref name=Toro/>{{sfn|Plath|1981|p=106}}{{efn-ua|Iquique was later occupied by Chile during the [[War of the Pacific]] and annexed by that country in 1883.}}

Nevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues that the story was refuted after it was discovered ''El Comercio de Iquique'' was actually referring to the invention of the [[whiskey sour]].<ref name=Toro/> This claim is further certified by the [[National University of Cuyo|University of Cuyo]], [[Argentina]], which in 1962 published the story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the whiskey sour in Iquique.

The pisco sour has three different methods of preparation.

Considerable variations exist in the pisco used in the cocktails.

Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their [[vintage]] year and the Chilean versions do not.<ref name=Tapia>{{cite web|url=http://piscosour.com/2013/01/entrevista-patricio-tapia-periodista-chileno-especializado-en-vinos/|title=Entrevista: Patricio Tapia – Periodista Chileno Especializado en Vinos|publisher=PiscoSour.com|year=2012|accessdate=3 July 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212195354/http://piscosour.com/2013/01/entrevista-patricio-tapia-periodista-chileno-especializado-en-vinos/ |archivedate = 12 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as ''[[Passiflora edulis|maracuya]]'', ''[[Physalis peruviana|aguaymanto]]'', and apples, or traditional ingredients such as the [[coca]] leaf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piscosour.com/?cat=3|title=Recetas|publisher=PiscoSour.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826225947/http://piscosour.com/?cat=3|archive-date=2012-08-26|dead-url=yes}}</ref> In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with [[mango]] juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the [[Yunqueño]] variant (from its [[Bolivian Yungas|Yungas region]]) replaces the lime with orange juice.{{sfn|Baez Kijac|2003|p=35}}

Cocktails similar to the pisco sour include the Chilean [[Piscola]] and the Peruvian [[Algarrobina Cocktail]]. Piscola is made by mixing pisco with [[cola]].{{sfn|Castillo-Feliú|2000|p=79}} The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, [[condensed milk]], and sap from the Peruvian ''[[Prosopis humilis|algarroba]]'' tree.{{sfn|Albala|2011|p=266}} Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian [[pisco punch]], originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.<ref>See:

Duggan McDonnell describes the pisco sour as "Latin America's most elegant cocktail, frothy, balanced, bright yet rich," adding that "Barkeeps throughout Northern California will attest that they have shaken many a Pisco sour. It is the egg white cocktail of choice and an absolutely beloved one by most."{{sfn|McDonnell|2015|p=170}} Australian journalist Kate Schneider writes that the pisco sour "has become so famous that there is an International Pisco Sour Day celebration on the first Saturday in February every year, as well as a [[Facebook]] page with more than 600,000 likes."<ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Kate |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/raise-a-glass-to-souring-your-trip/story-e6frfqai-1226311153834 |title=Kate Schneider Appreciates the Bitter Side of Life with South American Drink Pisco Sour |publisher=News.com.au |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> According to Chilean [[entrepreneur]] Rolando Hinrichs Oyarce, owner of a restaurant-bar in [[Spain]], "The pisco sour is highly international, just like [[Cebiche]], and so they are not too unknown" (Spanish: "''El pisco sour es bastante internacional, al igual que el cebiche, por lo tanto no son tan desconocidos''").<ref>{{cite news |title= Sours chilenos irrumpen en barrio mítico de Madrid |first= Marina |last= Alías |location= Santiago |newspaper= El Mercurio, Revista del Domingo |date= April 9, 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref> In 2003, Peru created the "''Día Nacional del Pisco Sour''" (National Pisco Sour Day), an official government holiday celebrated on the first Saturday of February.<ref name=Comercio>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/gastronomia/bares-y-copas/chile-tambien-tiene-su-bebida-nacional-hoy-celebran-dia-piscola-noticia-710673| title=Chile Celebra Hoy el Día de la Piscola |work=El Comercio| publisher=Empresa Editora El Comercio|date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2015 |language=Spanish}}</ref>{{efn-ua|The "''Día Nacional del Pisco Sour''" holiday was initially set for celebration on February 8.<ref name="Comercio"/> However, after the Chilean Pisco industry set its non-government sponsored "''Día de la Piscola''" (Piscola Day) also for celebration on February 8,<ref>{{cite web|author=Ruiz, Carlos |url=http://www.elobservatodo.cl/admin/render/noticia/19531|title=Hoy es el Día de la Piscola: Chilenos Celebran Uno de dus Tragos Típicos|publisher=ElObservatodo.cl|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Castro, Felipe|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/dia-de-la-piscola-a-tomar-combinados/noticias/2011-02-07/191611.html|title=Día de la Piscola: A Tomar Combinados|publisher=LaNacion.cl|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704105230/http://www.lanacion.cl/dia-de-la-piscola-a-tomar-combinados/noticias/2011-02-07/191611.html|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}</ref> Peru responded by changing its pisco sour holiday to its current date.<ref name=Comercio/>}}

During the 2008 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] Economic Leaders' Meeting, Peru promoted its pisco sour with widespread acceptance. The cocktail was reportedly the preferred drink of the attendees, mostly leaders, businessmen, and delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/agencia/noticia-apec-visitors-enjoyed-peruvian-pisco-sour-205750.aspx|title=APEC visitors enjoyed Peruvian pisco sour|publisher=Andina.com|date=24 November 2008|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> American [[celebrity chef]] [[Anthony Bourdain]] also drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his [[Travel Channel]] program ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|No Reservations]]'', he drank a pisco sour in Valparaíso, Chile, and said "that's good, but ... next time, I'll have a beer." The broadcaster [[Radio Programas del Perú]] reported that Jorge López Sotomayor, the episode's Chilean producer and Bourdain's travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the pisco sour he drank in Valparaíso as boring and worthless (in Spanish: "''A mí me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontró aburrido y que no valía la pena.''"). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2009-07-18-chef-anthony-bourdain-pisco-sour-chileno-es-aburrido-y-no-vale-la-pena-noticia_195507.html|title=Chef Anthony Bourdain: Pisco Sour Chileno es Aburrido y No Vale la Pena|work=Radio Programas del Perú| publisher=Grupo RPP|date=18 July 2009|accessdate=2 July 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref>

In Mexico, singer-songwriter [[Aleks Syntek]] humorously posted on [[Twitter]] that the pisco sour is Chilean and, after receiving critical responses to his statement, apologized and mentioned he was only joking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/detalle.php?nid=312238&op=7|title=Alex Syntek Dice Que el pisco sour y La Tigresa del Oriente Son Chilenos|work=Radio Programas del Perú|publisher=Grupo RPP|date=19 November 2010|accessdate=2 July 2015|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124075613/http://www.rpp.com.pe/detalle.php?nid=312238&op=7|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=}}</ref> Mexican television host and comedian [[Adal Ramones]] also joked about pisco sour, in reference to the [[2009 Chile–Peru espionage scandal]], on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a pisco sour (in Spanish: "''¿Qué quieren espiar los chilenos? ¿Cómo hacer pisco sour?''").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/television/adal-ramones-que-quieren-espiar-chilenos-como-se-hace-buen-pisco-sour-noticia-370244|title=Adal Ramones: "¿Qué Quieren Espiar los Chilenos? ¿Cómo Hacer Pisco Sour?"|work=El Comercio| publisher=Empresa Editora El Comercio|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=2 July 2015 |language=Spanish}}</ref>
