A '''Bloody Mary''' is a [[cocktail]] containing [[vodka]], [[tomato juice]], and combinations of other [[spice]]s and flavorings including [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[hot sauce]]s, garlic, herbs, [[horseradish]], [[celery]], [[olive]]s, [[salt]], [[black pepper]], [[lemon juice]], [[lime juice]] and/or [[celery salt]]. In the United States, it is usually consumed in the morning or early afternoon, and is popular as a [[hangover cure]].

The Bloody Mary was invented in the 1920s or 1930s; there are various theories as to the origin of the drink, as well as the origin of its name. It has many variants, most notably the Red Snapper, the Virgin Mary, the [[Caesar (cocktail)|Caesar]], and the [[Michelada]].

==History==
[[Fernand Petiot]] claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary in 1921, well before any of the later claims, according to his grand-daughter.<ref>{{cite web|first=Theodora|last=Sutcliffe|title=Fernand Petiot|url=https://www.diffordsguide.com/people/51603/bartender/fernand-petiot|website=Difford's Guide|publisher=Odd Firm of Sin Ltd|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>  He was working at the New York Bar in Paris at the time, which later became [[Harry's New York Bar]], a frequent Paris hangout for [[Ernest Hemingway]] and other American migrants.<ref>{{cite book|author=MacElhone, Andrew|author2= MacElhone, Duncan|last-author-amp=yes |title=Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails| page=35|isbn= 0-285-63358-9|publisher= Souvenir Press|origyear= 1986|year= 1996}}</ref> The original cocktail is said to have been created on the spur-of-the-moment, according to the bar's own traditions, consisting only of vodka and tomato juice.<ref name="BBC_Paris">{{cite web|last1=Chazan|first1=David|title=A century of Harry's Bar in Paris|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15887142|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=25 November 2011|quote="The story is that there were a few customers, a few friends, and the bartender, Pete [sic] Petiot, made a cocktail for them with tomato juice and vodka."}}</ref>  Harry's Bar also claims to have created numerous other classic cocktails, including the [[Sour (cocktail)#White Lady|White Lady]] and the [[Sidecar (cocktail)|Side Car]].<ref>The History of Harry's New York Bar - Book and Bar's Website article</ref>

New York's [[21 Club]] has two claims associated with it. One is that it was invented in the 1930s by a bartender named Henry Zbikiewicz, who was charged with mixing Bloody Marys. Another attributes its invention to the comedian [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], who frequented the 21 Club.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Andrew F. |date=2007|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|page= 55|publisher= Oxford University Press, Inc.|location= New York}}</ref> In 1939, [[Lucius Beebe]] printed in his gossip column ''This New York'' one of the earliest U.S. references to this drink, along with the original recipe: "George Jessel's newest pick-me-up which is receiving attention from the town's paragraphers is called a Bloody Mary: half tomato juice, half vodka".<ref>{{cite news|work=[[New York Herald Tribune]]|title=George Jessel's newest pick-me-up which is receiving attention from the town's paragraphers is called Bloody Mary|author=Lucius Beebe| date= December 2, 1939|page=9}}</ref>{{verify source|date=March 2014}} <!--We should really either have a way to check this source directly or cite a reliable source that says that the paper said this. The date seems possible, but I find it odd that in 1956 Jessel is claiming in advertisements that he MIGHT have invented the drink, and does not give a date for it. From the tone it sounds almost like he is joking and that it would have been recent to that date. See Talk: 'Origin' & 'Earliest "Bloody Mary" cites in 1939'-->

Fernand Petiot later claimed to have invented the modern Bloody Mary in 1934 as a refinement to Jessel's drink, at the [[King Cole Bar|King Cole Room]] in New York's [[St. Regis Hotel]], according to the hotel's own history.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Cole Bar: The History Of The Red Snapper|url=http://www.stregisnewyork.com/king-cole-bar|website=The St. Regis New York|publisher=Marriott International, Inc.|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>  When Petiot spoke to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in July 1964, he said:
<blockquote> "I initiated the Bloody Mary of today," he told us. "Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the [[cocktail shaker|shaker]] with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of [[black pepper]], two dashes of [[cayenne pepper]], and a layer of [[Worcestershire sauce]]; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/blogs/editor/2008/12/happy-birthday.html|title=Happy Birthday, Bloody Mary!|last=Park|first=Michael Y.|date=1 December 2008|publisher=Epicurious|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

The cocktail was claimed as a new cocktail under the name "Red Hammer" in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1942, consisting of tomato juice, vodka, and lemon juice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Hollywood goes Russian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fk4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38 |journal=Life magazine |location= |publisher= |year=1942 |page=38 |volume=13 |issue=8 |quote='Red Hammer' is a new Hollywood cocktail.

==Origin of the name==
The name "Bloody Mary" is associated with a number of historical figures—particularly [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I of England]], who was nicknamed as such in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' for attempting to re-establish the [[Catholic Church]] in England—and fictional women from [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|folklore]].

Some drink aficionados believe the inspiration for the name was Hollywood star [[Mary Pickford]].<ref>{{cite web

|title=Potent pick-me-up
|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]
|date=24 July 2002
|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> Others trace the name to a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the ''Bucket of Blood''.<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-36812420081201 Bloody Marys at 1933 prices just the tonic for NYC] Reuters, 2 December 2008</ref>  The tradition at ''[[Harry's New York Bar]]'' in Paris, according to manager Alain Da Silva in a 2011 interview, is that one of the patrons for whom the cocktail was first mixed in 1920 or 1921 declared, "It looks like my girlfriend who I met in a cabaret"; the cabaret's name was the ''Bucket of Blood'' and the girlfriend's name was ''Mary'', so the patrons and bartender [[Fernand Petiot|"Pete" Petiot]] agreed to call it a "Bloody Mary".<ref name="BBC_Paris" />

Yet another suggested origin of "Bloody Mary" is that the name in English simply arose from "a failure to pronounce the Slav syllables of a drink called Vladimir",<ref>{{cite book |last=Leigh Fermor |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Leigh Fermor |editor-last=Joliffe |editor-first=John |title=Auberon Herbert: A Composite Portrait |publisher= Michael Russell |date=November 1, 1976 | chapter=[[Auberon Herbert]] |isbn=978-0859550482}} Cited in {{cite book |last=Leigh Fermor |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Leigh Fermor |editor-last=Cooper |editor-first=Artemis |title=Words of Mercury |publisher=John Murray |year=2003 |isbn=978-0719561061 |page=160}}</ref>
which gains some credibility from the anecdotal observation that the customer at ''[[Harry's New York Bar|The New York Bar]]'' for whom [[Fernand Petiot]] prepared the drink in 1920/21 was [[Smirnoff#History|Vladimir Smirnov]], of the [[Smirnoff|Smirnoff vodka]] family.<ref>{{cite web |last=Samuels |first=Brian |title=The History of the Bloody Mary |publisher=The Boys Club |date=March 18, 2013 |url=http://theboysclub.net/brian/the-history-of-the-bloody-mary/ |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013104147/http://theboysclub.net/brian/the-history-of-the-bloody-mary/ |archive-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Preparation and serving==
In the United States, the Bloody Mary is a common "[[hair of the dog]]" drink, reputed to cure [[hangover]]s with its combination of a heavy vegetable base (to settle the stomach), salt (to replenish lost electrolytes), and alcohol (to relieve head and body aches). Bloody Mary enthusiasts enjoy some relief from the numbing effects of the alcohol, as well as the [[placebo effect]].<ref name="washingtonian">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/restaurants/8837.html|title=Here's to the Bloody Mary|last=Shoffner|first=Robert|date=2008-07-01|work=[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref><ref>[http://women.webmd.com/features/9-myths-about-your-hangover "9 Myths About Your Hangover"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225232328/http://women.webmd.com/features/9-myths-about-your-hangover |date=2011-12-25 }} by Dana Dudepohl, ''[[Marie Claire]]'', at WebMD.com</ref><ref>[http://www.cracked.com/funny-5644-bloody-marys/ But Does It Actually Cure Hangovers?] Cracked.com</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/30/news/mn-19052 Mud in Your Eye; a Sheep's Eye in Your Drink] Los Angeles Times, 30 December 2001</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zane-lamprey/why-i-love-the-bloody-mar_b_1118895.html Hangovers: There Is A Cure] Huffington Post, 29 November 2011</ref> Its reputation as a restorative beverage contributes to the popularity of the Bloody Mary in the morning and early afternoon, especially at [[brunch]]es.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576327380762930852 |title=The Bloody Mary Makeover |last=Garbarino |first=Steve |date=21 May 2011 |journal=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>

The drink is traditionally served over ice in a tall glass, such as a [[Highball glass|highball]], flared [[Pint glass|pint]] or [[hurricane glass]]. The two critical ingredients, vodka and tomato juice, are relatively simple; however, the drink almost never consists of these two ingredients alone. Among the more common additions to the juice base are salt or celery salt (either mixed in or as a salted rim), cracked pepper, hot sauce (such as [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]]), citrus juices (especially lemon or lime), [[Worcestershire sauce]], celery seed, horseradish, [[clam juice]] or olive brine, brown sugar or molasses, and/or [[bitters]]. Some or all of these ingredients can come pre-mixed with the tomato juice as a single "Bloody Mary mix" to which the vodka is added, or the drink may be hand-constructed by the bartender from raw ingredients according to the patron's preference. A common [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]] is a celery stalk when served in a tall glass; other common garnishes include olives, cheese cubes,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} a dill pickle spear, lemon wedges, dried [[sausage]], [[bacon]], and shrimp (as the taste of the drink is often reminiscent of [[shrimp cocktail]] sauce).

There is a considerable amount of variation available in the drink's construction and presentation including the use of different base spirits like bourbon, rye, tequila, or gin.  Gin is often preferred in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], sometimes called a Red Snapper (although this name is also used for other variants), or Ruddy Mary.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cloake|first1=Felicity|title=How to make the perfect bloody mary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/02/how-to-make-perfect-bloody-mary|website=theguardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=Eater>{{cite web|last1=Emen|first1=Jake|title=A Guide to the Bloody Mary and its Many Variations|url=https://www.eater.com/drinks/2016/2/16/10985162/bloody-mary-cocktail-guide|website=Eater|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=Feb 16, 2016}} This article lists many variations.</ref>  In addition to the aforementioned more traditional ingredients, practically anything can be added to the drink itself or as a garnish according to the drinker's wishes or the bartender's or establishment's traditions. Some variations of the Bloody Mary served by restaurants are designed to be a meal as well as a drink, coming with massive "garnishes" on skewers inserted into the glass, including ribs, miniature hamburgers called "sliders", grilled or fried shrimp, kebabs, sandwich wedges, fruit slices, and even [[sashimi]]. The drink itself can be served in any of a variety of glasses, from wine glasses to schooners or beer steins, according to tradition or availability.  It is a tradition in the upper Midwest, particularly in Wisconsin, to serve a Bloody Mary with a small beer chaser.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onmilwaukee.com/bars/articles/askomcbloodymarys.html|title=Ask OMC: Why do Bloodys come with beer chasers?|website=OnMilwaukee.com|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>

A '''Virgin Mary''', also known as a "Bloody Virgin" or "Bloody Shame" (the latter especially in [[Australian English vocabulary|Australia]]) is a [[Non-alcoholic mixed drink|non-alcoholic cocktail]], generally using the same ingredients and garnish as a Bloody Mary (according to local custom), but with the spirits replaced by additional tomato juice or prepared mix.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bartending/Cocktails/Bloody Mary|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bartending/Cocktails/Bloody_Mary&stable=0#Variations_in_alcohol|website=WikiBooks|publisher=WikiMedia|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=Eater />
