'''Caipirinha''' ({{IPA-pt|kajpiˈɾĩj̃ɐ}}) is [[Brazil]]'s national cocktail, made with [[cachaça]] ([[sugarcane]] hard [[liquor]]), [[sugar]], and [[Lime (fruit)|lime]].<ref name="law">{{cite web|url=http://www6.senado.gov.br/legislacao/ListaPublicacoes.action?id=237488|title=Lista de Publicações|publisher=Senado.gov.br|accessdate=2015-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224052558/http://www6.senado.gov.br/legislacao/ListaPublicacoes.action?id=237488|archivedate=2012-02-24|df=}}</ref> Cachaça,  also known as ''caninha'', or any one of a multitude of traditional names, is Brazil's most common [[distillation|distilled]] [[alcoholic beverage]]. Although both [[rum]] and cachaça are made from sugarcane-derived products, in cachaça the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is then distilled, while rum is usually made from refinery by-products such as [[molasses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocktailtimes.com/dictionary/cachacas.shtml |title= Cocktail Times - Dictionary |publisher=Cocktail Times |date= |accessdate=2015-03-18}}</ref>

The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, and adding the liquor. This can be made into a single glass, usually large, that can be shared amongst people, or into a larger jar, from which it is served in individual glasses.

==History==
Although the real origin of the drink is unknown, one account says that it came about around 1918 in the region of  [[Alentejo]] in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with [[lemon]], [[garlic]], and [[honey]], indicated for patients with the [[Spanish flu]]. Today, it is still being used as a remedy for the common cold. As it was quite common to add some [[distilled spirits]] to home remedies, in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, [[aguardente]] was commonly used. "Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few tablespoons sugar to reduce the acidity of lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat," explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cachaça).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revistacasaejardim.globo.com/Revista/Common/0%2c%2cEMI278045-16940%2c00-A+HISTORIA+DA+CAIPIRINHA.html |title=Casa e Jardim - NOTÍCIAS - A história da caipirinha |accessdate=2012-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117035757/http://revistacasaejardim.globo.com/Revista/Common/0%2C%2CEMI278045-16940%2C00-A%2BHISTORIA%2BDA%2BCAIPIRINHA.html |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= |quote=Até que um dia alguém resolveu tirar o alho e o mel.

According to historians, the caipirinha, as it is known nowadays, was invented by landowning farmers in the region of [[Piracicaba]], interior of the [[State of São Paulo]], during the 19th century, as a local drink for high standard events and parties, being a reflection of the strong sugarcane culture in the region.<ref>(in Portuguese) Cascudo, Luis da Camara (2006).

Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cachaça outside Brazil.<ref name="Everyday with Rachael Ray">{{cite web|last=Willey|first=Rob|url=http://www.belezabrazil.com/pages/pres_03.asp?id=70|publisher=Cane and Able|date=February 2006|title=Everyday with Rachael Ray|accessdate=2007-01-14|quote=The caipirinha—a sour-sweet combination of crushed limes, sugar and cachaça—has become the darling of American bartenders, and first-rate cachaça is at last finding a place on American liquor-store shelves.}}</ref> The [[International Bartenders Association]] has designated it as one of its [[IBA Official Cocktail|Official Cocktails]].<ref name="IBA" />

''Caipira'' is a [[Grammatical gender#Nouns with more than one gender|two-gender noun]]. The diminutive mostly refers to the drink, in which case it is a feminine noun.
