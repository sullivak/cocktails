'''The Godfather''' is a [[duo (cocktail)|duo mixed drink]] made of [[Scotch whisky]] (especially [[smoky whisky]])<ref>https://www.insider.com/best-2-ingredient-cocktails-2019-4</ref> and [[amaretto]]. Typically, the drink is served [[Straight up (bartending)#Definitions and usage|on the rocks]] in an [[old fashioned glass]].

==Name==
As with many cocktails, the origin of the Godfather's name is uncertain. The amaretto brand [[Disaronno]] claims the drink was the favorite cocktail of American actor [[Marlon Brando]], known for playing the titular character in the popular American [[The Godfather (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Mario Puzo|Mario Puzo's]] ''[[The Godfather]]'', which prominently features the [[American Mafia|Italian mob]].<ref name="DiSaronno">{{cite web |url=http://www.disaronno.com/drinks/godfather/ |title=The Godfather: A drink that commands respect |publisher=Disaronno |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> This may be an allusion to the cocktail's prominent use of amaretto, an Italian [[liqueur]].

The [[International Bartenders Association]] writes the name as two words, "God Father".<ref name="IBA"/>

==Variations==

Disaronno recommends a 1-to-2 ratio of amaretto to whisky (25&nbsp;ml amaretto to 50&nbsp;ml whisky)<ref name="DiSaronno"/> whereas the IBA recipe specifies a 1-to-1 ratio (35&nbsp;ml of each).<ref name="IBA">{{cite web |url=http://iba-world.com/cocktails/god-father/ |title=God Father |publisher=International Bartenders Association. |accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref>

[[Bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] is often used in place of scotch.

The Godmother cocktail uses [[vodka]] in place of whisky, while the [[French Connection (cocktail)|French Connection]] uses [[cognac]]. Both are popular cocktails in their own right and have been selected as [[IBA Official Cocktail]]s. The Godchild, meanwhile, replaces scotch with cream, leaving a drink with much less alcohol.
