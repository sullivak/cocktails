A '''Bellini''' is a [[cocktail]] made with [[Prosecco]] and [[peach]] [[purée]] or [[nectar (drink)|nectar]]. It originated in [[Venice]], Italy.

==History==
The Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948<ref name="3000 Cocktails">{{cite web | url = http://www.thatsthespirit.com/en/drinks/articles/Bellini.asp | title = 3000 Drinks > Bellini | date= n.d.| publisher=ThatsTheSpirit.com | accessdate= February 5, 2007 | archivedate= July 23, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120723052350/http://www.thatsthespirit.com/en/drinks/articles/Bellini.asp}}</ref><ref name="BBC Recipe">Jo' Pratt.

He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist [[Giovanni Bellini]].<ref name="Fabulous Foods">Sicard, Cheri.

The drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar.<ref name="Fabulous Foods" /> Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach purée to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.<ref name="3000 Cocktails" />

The Bellini is an [[IBA Official Cocktail]]. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach purée with an equal amount of [[mandarin orange|mandarin]] juice; a [[Rossini (cocktail)|Rossini]], which uses [[strawberry]] purée; or a Tintoretto, which is made with [[pomegranate]] juice.

==Preparation and serving==
The Bellini consists of puréed white peaches and [[Prosecco]], an Italian [[sparkling wine]]. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition.<ref name="3000 Cocktails" /> The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or [[cherry juice]] to give the drink a pink glow.<ref name="GourmetSleuth"/> Due in part to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.

California produces a white peach that works well,<ref name="California">[http://www.eatcaliforniafruit.com/freshipes/newsletters/03_2006_12.htm Featured Recipe: Peach Bellini Cocktail or Mocktail]. Undated. ''Freshipes''. California Tree Fruit Agreement. Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref> and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured [[liqueur]]s (peach [[schnapps]], for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach purée.

The Cipriani family produces Bellini Base for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civilization in a Glass.|url=http://www.newyorkfirst.com/gifts/m077.html|website=NewYorkFirst.com|accessdate=27 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419212716/http://www.newyorkfirst.com/gifts/m077.html|archivedate=April 19, 2010}}</ref>

Other sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or [[Carbonated water|seltzer]] is used in place of the wine.<ref name="Food Network">Chiarello, Michael.
