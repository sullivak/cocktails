==Variations==
The most common variation of the Alexander is the [[Brandy Alexander]], made with brandy.  Similarly, a Coffee Alexander substitutes [[coffee liqueur]] (such as [[Kahlúa]]) for gin, and a Blue Alexander substitutes [[Curaçao (liqueur)|blue Curaçao]] for crème de cacao.  Other variations exist.<ref name=dn>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drinknation.com/drinks/Alexander |title=Drinknation.com: Alexander variations |access-date=2008-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502184702/http://www.drinknation.com/drinks/Alexander |archive-date=2009-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

In ''Jack's Manual'' (1910) there is another cocktail called The Alexander which is a mixture of [[rye whiskey]] and [[Bénédictine]].<ref name="Jack" /> It is unclear whether or not this has any relation to the cream-based version.
