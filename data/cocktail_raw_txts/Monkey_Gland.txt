The '''Monkey Gland''' is a [[cocktail]] of [[gin]], [[orange juice]], [[grenadine]] and [[absinthe]]  created in the 1920s by [[Harry MacElhone]], owner of [[Harry's New York Bar]] in [[Paris, France]].<ref name="fieldguide">Rob Chirico, ''Field Guide to Cocktails'' p. 189, 2005 by Quirk Productions. {{ISBN|1-59474-063-1}}</ref> 

It is  named after the pseudo-scientific idea that grafting [[monkey]] [[testicle]] tissue into humans would increase [[longevity]], the idea developed by the Russian doctor [[Serge Voronoff]].<ref>Hirst, Christopher.
