While he was staying in Cuba, [[Ernest Hemingway]] tried the [[Floridita]]'s signature drink, the Floridita Daiquiri, and said "That's good but I prefer it without sugar and double rum,"<ref name="Floridita Daiquiri"/> creating a cocktail now known as the Hemingway Daiquiri or the Papa Doble.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Wayne|title=BEHIND THE DRINK: THE HEMINGWAY DAIQUIRI|url=http://www.liquor.com/articles/behind-the-drink-the-hemingway-daiquiri/#gs.I2zF=Nk|website=liquor.com|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> This recipe was later modified further, adding grapefruit juice to the mix, at which point the drink was dubbed the Hemingway Special."<ref name="Floridita Daiquiri"/>
